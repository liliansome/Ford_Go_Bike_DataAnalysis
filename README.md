## Ford Go Bike

>The data has information 183412 rides made in a bike-sharing system in the San Francisco Bay area. The outstanding features include duration in secs, customer type, gender etc

> In this investigation, I examined how various variables affect bike trips across the bay area and how customer characterisitics( age, gender) affect biking outcomes.


## Summary of Findings
 Therse were the summary of the findings. 
>  The peak hours are between 8.am and 9.am in the morning and 5-6pm in the eveinging. The number of trips gradually decreases at nightime. Also, there are more trips during the weekdays and less trips during the weekends. 
Also, there are more subscribers than customers. For the gender groups, the number of trips in male riders is  more than the number of trips in females. Most of riders are  between 25 to 40 years.

> Females spend more duration than males. Most of the durations are below 60000 secs and age  distributionis below 80 years .The customers are spending more time on a bike trip than subscribers. 

> All genders show similar trends in age and trip duration. There is a sharp decline in duration in people above 80 years across all genders 




## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on the duration of  rides versus hours, and  days. I start by checking out trip frequencies by hours and days of the week.

> Afterwards, I introduce each of the categorical variables one by one. To start, I use the boxplot plots of duration across duration and gender. The other two categorical variables, age and duration . Age, gender and duration are covered afterwards, using point plots.
